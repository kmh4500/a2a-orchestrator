Conversation Summary So Far:
${currentBlock || "(none)"}

Recent Message:
${latestSpeaker}: ${latestMessage}

Conversation Length: ${messageCount} messages
Evaluation Level: ${evaluationLevel}
Guidance: ${evaluationGuidance}

Please perform the following tasks:
1. Identify the purpose (intent) of the initial user message ${this.userIntent ? `(existing: ${this.userIntent})` : ''}
2. Determine if the current conversation has sufficiently satisfied the user's purpose
3. Or determine if the conversation is no longer making progress toward the user's purpose
4. **Apply the evaluation level based on conversation length** - longer conversations should be judged more strictly

Cases when the conversation should stop:
- Sufficient answers have been provided to the user's questions
- Information/recommendations/opinions requested by the user have been provided
- The conversation is repetitive or cycling without new insights
- The topic has completely deviated
- **For long conversations (${evaluationLevel}): Even minor repetition or lack of clear progress should trigger stopping**

Cases when the conversation should continue:
- The user's questions still lack sufficient answers
- The discussion is actively progressing with new ideas emerging
- More discussion is needed to achieve the user's purpose
- **For short conversations: Allow more exploration and discussion**
